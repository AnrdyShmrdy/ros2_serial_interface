Project this concerns: 
Testing stuff inside vscode_docker_workspace repo docker container. 
Work being done inside docker container with foxy and ros2_serial_interface package
Working folder in container: /dev_ws

Testing with serial_test.py:

First open two terminals and run "source install/setup.bash" in each of them

First Terminal: 
	First command: nc -l 60001
		- Sets up a netcat server to listen to messages on 127.0.0.1:60001

Second Terminal: 
	
	First command: socat pty,link=/dev/ttyAMA0,raw tcp:127.0.0.1:60001&
	
		- This command sets up /dev/ttyAMA0 to forward data to 127.0.0.1:60001 
		- The & allows this to run as a background task
	
	Second command: /bin/python3 /dev_ws/src/ros2_serial_interface/ros2_serial_interface/serial_test.py
	
		- Runs serial_test.py, which sends "test" to the device /dev/ttyAMA0.
		- The moment it arrives to /dev/ttyAMA0, it is forwarded to 127.0.0.1:60001
	
Sidenote: #maybe make a try-except-finally for different serial connections. Like if ttyAMA0 fails, try ttyS0, try COM1, etc

Testing with publisher_test.py:

First open three terminals and run "source install/setup.bash" in each of them

First Terminal: 
	First command: nc -l 60001
		- Sets up a netcat server to listen to messages on 127.0.0.1:60001

Second Terminal: 
	First command: socat pty,link=/dev/ttyAMA0,raw tcp:127.0.0.1:60001&
		- This command sets up /dev/ttyAMA0 to forward data to 127.0.0.1:60001 
		- The & allows this to run as a background task
	Second command: ros2 run ros2_serial_interface serial_controller 
		- Runs the serial_controller.py program, which listens to various ROS2 topics, like the wheel_instructions
Third Terminal: 
	First command: /bin/python3 /dev_ws/src/ros2_serial_interface/ros2_serial_interface/publisher_test.py
		- Runs publisher_test.py, which publishes various Twist messages to the wheel_instructions_topic
		- The serial_controller program reads the published messages and sends the appropriate response via serial to /dev/ttyAMA0
		- The moment it arrives to /dev/ttyAMA0, it is forwarded to 127.0.0.1:60001
