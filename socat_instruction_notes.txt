Project this concerns: Testing stuff inside vscode_docker_workspace repo docker container. Work being done inside docker container with foxy and ros2_serial_interface package
Working folder in container: /dev_ws

THIS TEST WORKS!!!

First Terminal: nc -l 60001

Second Terminal: 
	First command: socat pty,link=/dev/ttyAMA0,raw tcp:127.0.0.1:60001&
	The first command sets up /dev/ttyAMA0 to forward data to 127.0.0.1:60001. This command also runs in the background
	
	Second command: /bin/python3 /dev_ws/src/ros2_serial_interface/ros2_serial_interface/serial_test.py
	Second command sends "test" to the device /dev/ttyAMA0. The moment it arrives to /dev/ttyAMA0, socat forwards that to 127.0.0.1:60001
	
Sidenote: #maybe make a try-except-finally for different serial connections. Like if ttyAMA0 fails, try ttyS0, try COM1, etc
